# Capture Twin

A *captured twin* is a digital replica of a physical object, created using data from sensors or cameras. In Reality Composer, this process, known as  *3D Capture* , involves taking multiple images of an object from different angles and using *photogrammetry* to combine them into a 3D model. These models can then be imported into Reality Composer projects, allowing users to interact with them in AR environments.

* _Use Case_: Virtual Object Replica
