A captured twin is a virtual replica of a physical element. It is created using data collected from sensors, cameras, and other sources. A captured twin is called 3D Capture in Reality Composer. 3D Capture is a process for creating digital 3D models of physical objects by capturing multiple images from different angles. It uses photogrammetry to stitch together these images into a 3D model. Reality Composer supports importing these models directly into projects, where you can interact with and manipulate them for AR applications.
